# Function-Expressions

**Goal:** Practice storing functions in variables and calling them.

## Tasks
- STEP 1 — Make a variable addExpr that stores a function expression which returns a+b.
- STEP 2 — Make a variable sayByeExpr that stores a function expression which returns 'Bye, <name>!'
- STEP 3 — Make a variable isEvenExpr that stores a function expression which returns true if n is even.
- STEP 4 — Make a variable pickLongerExpr that returns the longer of two strings.
- STEP 5 — TEST: Log calls to each expression to the console with sample inputs.

## Quick Tips
- Use `console.log()` to check your results.
- Comment your code if something is confusing.
- Small steps first; test as you go.
