# Anonymous-Functions

**Goal:** Practice unnamed callbacks in array methods and timers.

## Tasks
- STEP 1 — Use setTimeout with an anonymous function to log 'Done!' after 500ms.
- STEP 2 — Make an array of numbers and use forEach with an anonymous function to log each double.
- STEP 3 — Use map with an anonymous function to return numbers squared.
- STEP 4 — Use filter with an anonymous function to keep only strings longer than 3 letters from ['pen','book','AI','tool'].
- STEP 5 — Use reduce with an anonymous function to sum an array; log the result.

## Quick Tips
- Use `console.log()` to check your results.
- Comment your code if something is confusing.
- Small steps first; test as you go.
