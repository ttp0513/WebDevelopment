# Traditional-Functions

**Goal:** Practice traditional function declarations (hoisting, parameters, return).

## Tasks
- STEP 1 — Create a function named add that takes two numbers and returns the sum.
- STEP 2 — Create a function named greet that takes a name and returns the string 'Hello, <name>!'
- STEP 3 — Create a function named isAdult that takes an age and returns true if age >= 18, otherwise false.
- STEP 4 — Create a function named maxOfThree that returns the largest of three numbers.
- STEP 5 — TEST: Log each function call result to the console with sample inputs.

## Quick Tips
- Use `console.log()` to check your results.
- Comment your code if something is confusing.
- Small steps first; test as you go.
