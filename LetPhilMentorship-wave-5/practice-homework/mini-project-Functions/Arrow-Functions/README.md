# Arrow-Functions

**Goal:** Practice ES6 arrow syntax, one-liners, and returns.

## Tasks
- STEP 1 — Make a constant addArrow assigned to an arrow function that returns a+b.
- STEP 2 — Make a constant squareArrow that returns n*n (use concise one-line form).
- STEP 3 — Make a constant describeArrow that takes (name, city) and returns a sentence.
- STEP 4 — Make a constant maxArrow that returns the max of two numbers using a conditional (?:).
- STEP 5 — TEST: Log calls to each arrow function with sample values.

## Quick Tips
- Use `console.log()` to check your results.
- Comment your code if something is confusing.
- Small steps first; test as you go.
