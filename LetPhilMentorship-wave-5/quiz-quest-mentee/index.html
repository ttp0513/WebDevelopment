    <!-- STEP 2: Set the title that appears on the browser tab.
         You can change the emoji if you want! -->
    <title>Quiz Quest üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</title>

    <!-- STEP 3: Connect this HTML file to a CSS file called "styles.css".
         This is where your background, fonts, colors, and button styles will live.
         Make sure styles.css is saved in the same folder as this file. -->

    <!-- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STEP 4: Create the "Start Screen"
         This is what the player sees first.
         Create a <section> with id="start-screen".
         Give it the class "screen" so it's styled like a game screen.
         Add an extra class "showing" so it appears first when the page loads.
         Inside it, add:
         - An <h1> tag for the game title
         - A <p> tag with a short welcome message
         - A <button> with id="start-btn" and class="btn primary" that says "Start Quest"
         JavaScript will later detect when this button is clicked to begin the game.
    -->

    <!-- üß† STEP 5: Create the "Question Screen"
         This is where the player will answer quiz questions.
         Use a <section> with id="question-screen" and class="screen hidden".
         (The "hidden" class means it's invisible until we want to show it using JavaScript.)

         Inside it, add:
         1. A <div> with id="timer" and aria-live="polite" ‚Äì this shows the countdown clock.
         2. An <h2> with id="question-text" ‚Äì JavaScript will insert the question text here.
         3. A <div> with id="answers" and class="answers" ‚Äì this will be filled with answer buttons using JS.
    -->

    <!-- üéâ STEP 6: Create the "Result Screen"
         After the last question, we show the player their results.
         Use a <section> with id="result-screen" and class="screen hidden".

         Inside it, add:
         1. A <h2> with id="result-message" and aria-live="polite" ‚Äì shows a custom message.
         2. A <p> with id="final-score" ‚Äì shows something like "You scored 3 / 4".
         3. A <button> with id="restart-btn" and class="btn secondary" ‚Äì when clicked, it restarts the game.
    -->

    <!-- üß© STEP 7: Link your JavaScript file
         Create a file named "script.js" in the same folder as this HTML file.
         This is where ALL your game logic will go ‚Äì from switching screens to checking answers.

         This line loads that file. Leave it at the very bottom of <body>.
    -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
