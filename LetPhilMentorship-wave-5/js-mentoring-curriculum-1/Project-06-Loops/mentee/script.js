// STEP 1: Use a for loop to count from 1 to 3
// (Write a for loop starting at 1; run while <= 3; increase by 1; log the counter.)

// STEP 2: Use a for loop to print 5 stars
// (Write a for loop that runs 5 times; log "⭐" each time.)

// STEP 3: Loop through an array of fruits and log each one
// (Create const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]; use a for loop with i < fruits.length and log each item.)

// STEP 4: Use a loop to print even numbers from 2 to 10
// (Start at 2; increment by 2; stop at 10; log each number.)

// STEP 5: Loop backwards from 5 to 1
// (Start at 5; decrement by 1; stop at 1; log each number.)

// STEP 6: Loop through letters in a string
// (Create let word = "hello"; loop over its length and log each character.)

// STEP 7: Use a while loop to count from 1 to 3
// (Make a counter that starts at 1; while it’s <= 3, log it; remember to increment.)

// STEP 8: Use a while loop to print 5 stars
// (Start a counter at 0; while it’s < 5, log "⭐"; increment after logging.)

// STEP 9: Loop through the same fruits array using a while loop and log each one
// (Use an index that starts at 0; while index < fruits.length, log fruits[index]; increment index.)

// STEP 10: Use a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 10
// (Start at 2; while <= 10, log the number; add 2 each time.)

// STEP 11: Use a while loop to loop backwards from 5 to 1
// (Start at 5; while >= 1, log the number; subtract 1 each loop.)

// STEP 12: Use a while loop to loop through letters in the same string
// (Use an index starting at 0; while index < word.length, log word[index]; then increment.)
