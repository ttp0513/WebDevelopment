# ðŸ“˜ Day 16 Journal â€“ JavaScript - Event Object
## âœ… What I did
Todayâ€™s learning was toughâ€”wrapping my head around event objects, animation loops, and the Canvas API definitely stretched me. But once I got the cat to walk across the screen using animate() and requestAnimationFrame(), it felt like magic. Seeing code come to life reminded me why this journey is worth it. Itâ€™s challenging, yesâ€”but also incredibly exciting when things finally move.

## Event Object
#### Definition
The Event Object is a special object automatically passed to event handler functions.

It contains information about the event that occurred and methods to control its behavior.

Itâ€™s triggered when a user interacts with the web page (e.g., clicks, types, scrolls).

### Always-Have Properties
#### `type`
- Describes the kind of event that occurred.
- These values will correspond to the same values you might pass to `addEventListener()`
    - `"keydown"`
    - `"click:`
    - `"submit"`
#### `target`
- Refers to the DOM element that triggered the event.
    - `document`
    - `window` 
    - `event.target` => often used to access the clicked or typed element

### Common Methods
#### `preventDefault()`
Cancels the default action (e.g., form submission, link navigation)

#### `stopPropagation()`
Prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements

#### `addEventListener()`
Listen for event and respond to them
It takes two arguments:
- First argument: the event listened for
- Second argument: the function that will be called when the event occurs (this can be **null** or object that use `EventListener` interface)
```js
element.addEventListener("click", ()=> {
  // code to run when the click event occurs
})
// or 
function handleClick {
  //code run when the click event occurs
};
element.addEventListener("event", handleClick);
```

#### `removeEventListener()`
Used to remove an event listener that was previously added to an element using the `addEventListener()` method.
This takes 2 arguments, with a 3rd as optional:
- First argument: the event to remove
- Second argument: function that was previously added
- Third argument: either `options` or `useCapture`
  - `options`: an object that specifies the options for the event listener, such as whether the event listener should be passive or once
  - `useCapture`: a boolean value that specifies whether the event should be captured during the event propagation phase

##### Real-world usage:
- Removing event listeners when a modal is closed in a web application or when a user logs out of an application

#### Special Case: `FetchEvent`
- Used in **Service Workers** (not typical in basic DOM events).
- Contains a request property representing the network request that triggered the event.

```js
document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Stops form from submitting
  console.log("Form submitted:", event.target);
});
```

## Event Handlers
### `event.target.value`
event: The object automatically passed to an event listener.

target: The HTML element that triggered the event.

value: The current value of that element (usually from an \<input>, \<textarea>, or \<select>)

```js
element.addEventListener("eventType", function(event) {
  const inputValue = event.target.value;
});
```
#### Common Use Cases
1. Capturing user input in real time (input, change)
2. Form validation
3. Search bars
4. Live filtering or updating UI

### Inline Event Handlers
- Inline event handlers (`onclick`) are special attributes on an HTML element that are used to execute JavaScript code when an event occurs.

- Inline event handlers can only be used to attach one event listener to an element

```js
<button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Show alert</button>
// When the user clicks on the button, the alert function is called and an alert dialog is displayed with the message Hello World!.
```

### Style Manipulation
Once an event (like a click or keypress) is captured by an event handler, you can use the Event Object to identify the target and then manipulate its appearance using:

#### `element.style`
- Directly modifies inline styles of the element
- Can override CSS rules and become hard to maintain 

```js
element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'
element.style.display ='none'
```
#### `element.classList`
- A read-only property that can be used to add, remove, or toggle classes on an element.
- Can be used to add multiple classes by passing them as arguments to the `classList.add()` method
- Remove a class from element with `classList.remove()`
- To toggle a class on an element, use `classList.toggle()`

```js
// add the `highlight` class to the paragraph element using `classList.add()`
const paraE1 = document.getElementById('para');
paraE1.classList.add("highlight");

// add multiple classes to the paragraph element
paraE1.classList.add('class1', 'class2', 'class3');

// remove class from the paragraph elemet
paraE1.classList.remove('class1');
```

### `DOMContentLoadedEvent` vs `load`

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when everything in the HTML document has been loaded and parsed.
  - If you have external stylesheets, or images, the DOMContentLoaded event will not wait for those to be loaded. It will only wait for the HTML to be loaded.
  - Unlike `load` event which waits for everything to be loaded

### Delay - Repeat Manipulation
#### `setTimeout` - `clearTimeOut`
- `setTimeout` delays an action for a specified time
- `clearTimeout()` stops a timeout by taking the timeout ID

```js
setTimeout(function, delay (in milliseconds))
```

```js
const timeOut = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 3 seconds");
}, 3000);

clearTimeout(timeOut)
```

#### `setInterval`- `clearInterval`
- `setInterval` keeps repeating a function at a set interval
- Best for creating an animation that moves continuously or refreshing stock data.
- Stop the repeat with `clearInterval()`by passing the interval ID as argument into the method

```js
setInterval(function, delay (in milliseconds));
```
```js
setInterval(() = {
  console.log("This runs every 2 seconds")
}, 2000);
// This runs every 2 seconds
// This runs every 2 seconds
// This runs every 2 seconds
```

```js
const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("This will stop after 5 seconds");
}, 1000;)

setTimeOut(() => {
  clearInterval(intervalID);
}, 5000); // stop the repeat after 5 seconds
```
### Animation Loop - `requestAnimationFrame()`
- A browser API that schedules a function to run before the **next screen repaint**, aka the moment when the browser refreshes the visual display of the web page, usually around 60 times per second (60fps)
- Ideal for smooth, efficient animations (typically ~60 frames per second).
- Replaces older timing methods like setInterval() for better performance.

#### How it works
1. Define an `update()` function to change styles or positions.
2. Define an `animate()` function that:
- Calls update()
- Recursively calls requestAnimationFrame(animate)
3. Kick off the loop with `requestAnimationFrame(animate)`

### Web Animation API (WAAPI) - `animate()`
- WAAPI allows user to create and control animations directly within JS using `animate()` method.
- It provides more flexibility than CSS animations, especially for dynamic, interactive, or programmatically controlled effects.

```js
element.animate(keyframes, options);
```
- `keyframes`: an array or object defining the animation steps (e.g., { opacity: [0, 1] })

- `options`: timing settings like duration, iterations, easing
#### CSS animations vs WAAPI

### Canvas API
The Canvas API lets you draw graphics directly in JavaScript using the \<canvas> HTML element.

Itâ€™s ideal for creating shapes, text, animations, games, and visualizations.

The canvas is a blank drawing surface that you manipulate using JavaScript.

### Dialog Element
- `dialog` let users display important info or actions to users.
  - A **modal dialog**: a type of dialog that forces the user to interact with it before they can access the rest of the application or webpage
  - A **non-modal dialog**: allows the user to continue interacting with other parts of the page or application even when the dialog is open
