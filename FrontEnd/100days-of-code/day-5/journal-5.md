# üìò Day 5 ‚Äì Web Development Learning Summary

## üìù Summary  
Today, I dove deep into **CSS Grid** and **Media Query**, and it completely changed how I think about structuring web pages. Grid gave me precise control over placement, spacing, and responsiveness, and it felt like I was designing with invisible blueprints. I combined this with my growing knowledge of **CSS layout, typography** to build a full **Magazine Project**, which challenged me to balance visual hierarchy, readability, and design flow.

I practiced defining grid containers, setting up columns and rows, and using properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-column`, and `place-items` to align content. The project also helped me refine my use of semantic HTML and responsive design principles. Seeing everything come together‚Äîthe fonts, spacing, layout, and color‚Äîwas incredibly satisfying.

## üß± CSS Grid Fundamentals

### Grid Container
- `display: grid`: Turns an element into a grid container.
- `grid-template-columns`: Defines column structure (e.g., `repeat(3, 1fr)`).
- `grid-template-rows`: Defines row structure.
- `gap`: Adds spacing between rows and columns.

### Grid Items
- `grid-column`: Controls horizontal span (e.g., `1 / -1`).
- `grid-row`: Controls vertical span.
- `place-items`: Aligns items both vertically and horizontally.
- `grid-area`: Names and positions items using template areas.

## üì± Media Query Essentials

- Media queries allow you to adapt styles based on screen size, device type, or orientation.
- They‚Äôre essential for building responsive layouts that work across desktops, tablets, and phones.

- `max-width: 720px`: Tablet landscape
- `max-width: 600px`: Tablet portrait / small screens
- `max-width: 550px`: Mobile adjustments for typography and layout
- `max-width: 420px`: Very small devices
- `only screen`: a media type filter that targets screen-based devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones) while ignoring other media types like print or speech

Example:
`@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)`{}: styles for screens smaller than 600px

## üß™ Mini Project: Magazine Layout

### Applied Concepts
- Multi-column layout using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-gap`.
- Hero section spanning full width with `grid-column: 1 / -1`.
- Sidebar and main content aligned using fractional units (`fr`).
- Typography styled with Google Fonts for headlines and body text.
- Responsive adjustments with media queries for mobile readability.
- Semantic HTML structure with `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`.
- Used `font-family`, `font-size`, and `line-height` to create visual rhythm.
- Applied `text-align` and `letter-spacing` for clean, readable columns.
- Balanced headings and body text using `font-weight` and spacing.
- Ensured consistent margins and padding across sections using the box model.

This project helped me understand more about how **CSS Grid** creates structured designs used in many magazines.
