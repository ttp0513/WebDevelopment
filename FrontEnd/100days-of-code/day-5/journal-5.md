# 📘 Day 5 – Web Development Learning Summary

## 📝 Summary  
Today, I dove deep into **CSS Grid**, and it completely changed how I think about structuring web pages. Grid gave me precise control over placement, spacing, and responsiveness, and it felt like I was designing with invisible blueprints. I combined this with my growing knowledge of **CSS layout, typography** to build a full **Magazine Project**, which challenged me to balance visual hierarchy, readability, and design flow.

I practiced defining grid containers, setting up columns and rows, and using properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-column`, and `place-items` to align content. The project also helped me refine my use of semantic HTML and responsive design principles. Seeing everything come together—the fonts, spacing, layout, and color—was incredibly satisfying.

## 🧱 CSS Grid Fundamentals

### Grid Container
- `display: grid`: Turns an element into a grid container.
- `grid-template-columns`: Defines column structure (e.g., `repeat(3, 1fr)`).
- `grid-template-rows`: Defines row structure.
- `gap`: Adds spacing between rows and columns.

### Grid Items
- `grid-column`: Controls horizontal span (e.g., `1 / -1`).
- `grid-row`: Controls vertical span.
- `place-items`: Aligns items both vertically and horizontally.
- `grid-area`: Names and positions items using template areas.

## 🧪 Mini Project: Magazine Layout

### Applied Concepts
- Multi-column layout using `grid-template-columns` and `grid-gap`.
- Hero section spanning full width with `grid-column: 1 / -1`.
- Sidebar and main content aligned using fractional units (`fr`).
- Typography styled with Google Fonts for headlines and body text.
- Responsive adjustments with media queries for mobile readability.
- Semantic HTML structure with `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`.
- Used `font-family`, `font-size`, and `line-height` to create visual rhythm.
- Applied `text-align` and `letter-spacing` for clean, readable columns.
- Balanced headings and body text using `font-weight` and spacing.
- Ensured consistent margins and padding across sections using the box model.

This project helped me understand more about how **CSS Grid** creates structured designs used in many magazines.
