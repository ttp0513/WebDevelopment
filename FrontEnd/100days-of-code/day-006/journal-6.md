# 📘 Day 6 Journal – CSS Form & Registration Project

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Today I focused on learning how to style forms with CSS and completed the FreeCodeCamp registration form project. I practiced building a clean, responsive layout and learned how to make forms more user-friendly and accessible.

- I used `label` with `for` to link labels to inputs, and added `name` attributes so the form could send data properly. I styled inputs with padding, borders, and focus outlines, and made the form responsive using `max-width` and media queries.

- This project helped me understand how structure and style work together to create intuitive forms. It felt great to see everything come together visually and functionally.

## 🎨 CSS Concepts Practiced
- `box-sizing: border-box` for consistent sizing.
- `padding`, `margin`, and `border-radius` for clean spacing and rounded corners.
- `:focus` pseudo-class to highlight active inputs.
- Styled buttons with hover effects and full-width layout.
- Used `max-width` and media queries for responsive design.

## 🧩 HTML Form Structure
- Used `label for="id"` to link labels to inputs.
- Added `name="x"` to inputs for form data submission.
- Included `required` and semantic input types (`email`, `password`, etc.).

## 🖼️ Visual Summary

<label for="email">Email</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
