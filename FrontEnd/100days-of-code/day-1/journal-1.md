Today, I began my web development journey by studying the foundational structure of HTML. I gained a clear understanding of how HTML organizes content on a webpage using elements such as <html>, <head>, and <body>, as well as semantic tags like <header>, <main>, and <footer>. This provided valuable insight into how websites are logically structured for both users and developers.

To reinforce these concepts, I completed several interactive labs on FreeCodeCamp. These exercises allowed me to apply what I learned in a practical setting and helped solidify my grasp of HTML syntax and layout principles.

Overall, it was a productive start. Iâ€™m looking forward to building on this foundation and exploring CSS next.
