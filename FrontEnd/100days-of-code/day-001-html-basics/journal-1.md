# Day 1 ‚Äì Web Development Learning Summary

## üìù Summary
Today, I focused on mastering the **HTML5 document structure and semantic tags**, which form the foundation of every web page. I explored how to declare a valid HTML5 document, organize metadata, and use semantic elements to give meaning and accessibility to content. To reinforce these concepts, I built a demo page that included headings, sections, lists, tables, and a form ‚Äî all structured with semantic clarity. This hands-on experience helped me understand how HTML communicates intent to both browsers and users.

## üß± HTML5 Document Structure

### Core Elements
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document as HTML5.
- `<html lang="en">`: Root element with language specification.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata like charset, author, description, keywords, viewport, title, favicon, and stylesheet.
- `<body>`: Holds all visible content rendered in the browser.

## üß© Semantic Tags

### Tags I Practiced
- `<header>`: Introduces the page with headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- `<section>`: Defines thematic sections of content.
- `<div>`: Generic block container (non-semantic).
- `<span>`: Inline styling for specific words or phrases.
- `<table>`: Displays tabular data (used for a daily schedule).
- `<ul>` / `<ol>`: Lists for unordered and ordered items.
- `<form>`: Collects user input with fields, labels, and buttons.
- `<footer>`: Contains copyright and contact info.
