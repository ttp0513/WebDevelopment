# ðŸ“˜ Day 12 Journal â€“ JavaScript - Objects

## âœ… What I Did Today

## Object Facts
- Objects are incredibly versatile and form the backbone of JavaScript. 
- In fact, almost everything in JavaScript is an object or can be treated as one, these includes: array, objects, numbers, string, functions, etc...

### Structure of the Object
Object = cabinet holds different folders (properties), each folder contains a piece of info (value)

```js
const exampleObject = {
  propertyName1: value1;
  propertyName2: value2;
  ...
}
```
### Object Access
#### Dot Notation 
- Dot notation is used to access a property when you know its exact name and itâ€™s a valid JavaScript identifier.
- `properties.Name` needs to be *valid JS identified*, aka cannot start with a number, contain spaces, or include special characters (like -, @, etc.).
##### Single Object `objectName.property.Name`
##### Nested Object `objectName.propertyA.propertyB(inA).propertyC(inB)`
You can chain dot notation to access properties inside nested objects.
```js
const company = {
  department: { manager: { name: "John"}}};
console.log(company.department.manager.name); // "John"
```

#### Bracket Notation
- Bracket notation allows you to access object properties using a string inside square brackets. 
- Bracket notation is more flexible than dot notation because:
    - ["propertiesName"] can be *invalid JS identifiers*, aka can start with a number, or contains space
    - Can use variables to access properties dynamically

##### Single Object `objectName["propertiesName"]`
    ```js
    const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    1stcity: "Wonderland"
    };
    let propertyName = "1stcity";
    console.log(person[propertyName]); // Wonderland
    ```
- Use Case:
    - When you don't know the exact property name at the time of writing the code
    - When you are working with property names that come from user input or dynamic source

##### Nested Object `objectName["propertyA"]["propertyB(inA)]`
```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  contact: {
    email: "alice@example.com",
    addresses: [
    { type: "home", street: "123 Main St", city: "Anytown" },
    { type: "work", street: "456 Market St", city: "Workville" }
  ]
  } 
};
console.log(person['contact']['addresses'][1]['city']); //Workville
```
### Object Destructuring
#### Benefit
- Allows user to extract values from objects and assign them to variables
- Allows user to assign the extracted values to variables with different names
- Allows user to set default values, even when the property doesn't exist in the object when destructuring
- **Shorthand notation** When you're creating objects, especially when the property names match variable names, you can takes the properties with the same name as our variables and assigns them the values of those variables.

```js
// Create an object
const user = {
  name: "The Phan",
  role: "Analyst",
  location: "Georgia"
};

//  1. Extract values and assign to variables
const { name, role } = user;
console.log(name); // "The Phan"
console.log(role); // "Analyst"

//  2. Assign to variables with different names
const { location: userLocation } = user;
console.log(userLocation); // "Georgia"

//  3. Set default values for missing properties
const { department = "Strategy", level = "Mid" } = user;
console.log(department); // "Strategy" (default used)
console.log(level);      // "Mid" (default used)

// 4. Shorthand notation
let name = 'Bob';
let role = 'SWE';
let user2 = {name, role};
console.log(user2); // {name: 'Bob, role: 'SWE'}
```
#### Use Case
- Working with objects that have property that might conflict with existing variables
- Want to use a different name for property in the object
- Shorthand notation is particularly useful when you are returning objects from functions or creating objects with 

### Object Deletion
#### `delete`
`delete objectName.propertyName`: removes the selected property from the object
```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  job: "Engineer"
};
delete person.job;
console.log(person.job); // undefined
```
#### Object Destructuring with `...rest`
2. Use object destructuring assignment with rest parameters `...`: this does not remove the selected property but create a new object without the selected property
```js
const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 28,
  job: "AI Engineer"
};
const {job, ...rest} = personID;
console.log(rest); // { name: "Bob", age: 28 }
```
### Object Checking Property
#### `hasOwnProperty()`
- `hasOwnProperty()` returns a boolean that shows whether the object has the specified property
```js
console.log(objectName.hasOwnProperty('propertyName'));
```

#### `in` operator
`in` also returns true if the property exists on the object and vice versa
```js
console.log('propertyName' in objectName);
```
#### `!== undefined`
This method involves checking if a property is not `undefined`on the object.
- `true` => the property is included on the object
- `false` => the property is not on the object
- Limitation: this can give false negative (the property exists but JS indicates it doesn't ) if a property has the value `undefined`

```js
const car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: undefined,
};

console.log(car.brand !== undefined); // true
console.log(car.color !== undefined); // false
console.log(car.year !== undefined); // false
```
### Object Duplication
When you create a non-primitive value, what's stored in the variable is a reference to the location in memory where the object is stored, not the object itself. This results in when creating a copy of the object `copiedObject`, it is copying the reference to the object `originalObject`. This is known as shallow copying by reference. As a result, any changes made to the object through one reference are reflected in all references to that object

```js
const originalPerson = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const copiedPerson = originalPerson;
originalPerson.age = 31;
console.log(copiedPerson.age); // 31
```

### Object Methods

#### Difference between functions vs object methods:
1. Functions are called by their name, while methods are called using dot notation on the object they belong to.
```js
// Function
greet("Alice")
// Object Method
person.sayHello()
```
2. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, while Object Methods are functions that are associated with an object.

3.  Regular functions have their own scope, but they don't have a built-in reference to any particular object. Methods, however, are bound to their object and can access its properties and other methods using the `this` keyword.
    - `this` allows the specified object method to access the properties of the object

```js
const person = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 30,
    sayHello: function() {
        return "Hello, my name is " + this.name;
    }
};
console.log(person.sayHello()); // "Hello, my name is Bob"
```
