# What is React?
React is a JS Library, not a Framework
 - Framework tries to handle everything when building an app (routing, managing complex app logic, HTTP request, infrastructure, etc...)
`React focuses on doing one specific thing really well: building web and mobile user interfaces (UI)`
React has a massive ecosystem of other libraries and work perfect with them
When some features are needed, React can easily be plugged in the right tools to perform the jobs, making React more flexible and easier to learn

# Why learn React?
## Well-known Reasons
1. Most popular library for building user interfaces, used by many companies including Meta, Netflix, Amazon and more
2. AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor and others are amazing at generating React code => When working with React, users can get support of AI tools and grow their skills
3. React dominates the job market and the open-source ecosystem

## Technical Reasons
1. React has a component-based architecture, allowing users to break UI into small, reusable pieces (header, aside, main ,footer), which can be composed to make more complex UIs.
2. React is declarative
    - Users describes what they want the UI to look like, and React takes care of building and updating the actual UI
3. React makes no assumptions about the rest of the tech stack users are using for the project
    - React can integrate into any of the applications
    - Users can use React to build mobile applications with React Native
